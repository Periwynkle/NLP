    "The more sophisticated approach adopted here considers the *context* of each token: the words preceding and following it, as well as their POS tags. This makes linguistic sense - articles such as 'the' and 'a' come before nouns and form chunks with them; 'to' often comes before verbs. Thus, context also allows for distinctions to be drawn between [words that can be verbs and nouns](https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/nounandverb.shtml).\n",

To save time, the classifier was tested on only 10,000 tokens. Apart from tokens and POS tags, stemming (a non-lexicographical representation of the root form of a word), capitalisation, and tokens up to two indices before or after were considered, along with their POS tags. The previous chunk tag was also added.\n",

    "Five classifiers were selected due to their popular use in supervised classification tasks for multiclass data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree**: this is the most easily interpretable model, given that it can be represented as a series of logical rules (if-then statements). \n",
    "- Entropy was chosen over the default Gini impurity for the criterion argument (which measures the quality of a split), because it is suited for nominative as opposed to continuous attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial Naïve Bayes**: another simple classifier for discrete data that is computationally very lightweight and biased toward the modal category. This variant is suited for occurrence counts (as opposed to Boolean features).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression (Maximum Entropy)**: with its default settings, this is also a computationally lightweight algorithm. It considers probability distributions that are 'empirically consistent' with the training data (estimated frequencies of class and feature vector co-occurrences are close to actual frequencies). The distribution with the highest entropy (i.e., the most uniform) is selected. \n",
    "- As classes are highly imbalanced in this dataset (as demonstrated by the exploratory analysis above), the 'balanced' option of the `class_weight` argument is selected to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data.\n",
    "- I experimented with the SAGA solver, a variant of Stochastic Average Gradient descent that supports L1 Regularization. It is therefore the solver of choice for sparse multinomial logistic regression, and is suitable for large datasets. However, this version was far too computationally intense, so I reverted back to liblinear (the default - not as ideal for multiclass, but still achieves quite high accuracies).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)**: in my personal experience with text classification this is the best-performing model, so I had to test it! LinearSVC is an effective mainstream approximation of SVMs, which maximises the margin between the hyperplane (decision boundary) and individual data points in the feature space. It works well with high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "- LinearSVC also has a `class_weight` parameter, and it was set to 'balanced'.\n",
    "- When testing the default version of LinearSVC, I received this error message: `ConvergenceWarning: Liblinear failed to converge, increase the number of iterations. Default max_iter is 1000.` I increased `max_iter` to 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Voting Ensemble (Weighted Probability Distribution Voting)**: this classifier combines the decisions of others, and I used the previous four classifiers given their high accuracies. I could not use soft voting (which predicts the class label based on the argmax of the sums of the predicted probabilities as opposed to predicted class labels) because LinearSVC does not produce predicted probabilities (it has no attribute `predict_proba`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: I tried two other ensemble classifiers, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, which both represent more sophisticated versions of decision trees. The added sophistication also increases model complexity and required computational power, so neither was adopted in the end. Despite its added complexity, Random Forest is less accurate than the Decision Tree (when trained on 10,000 data points). It reaches a maximum accuracy at about 30 estimators:\n",

    "The classifiers tested here all have a fixed decision-making approach: the chunk labels that are made cannot be changed. An alternative approach suggested by the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html) is represented by **transformational joint classifiers**, which create initial label assignments that are iteratively refined if inconsistencies are found between related inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution suggested by the book is assigning scores to all possible chunk sequences, and choosing the sequence with the highest overall score. This is represented by **Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Markov Models, and Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields**. Rather than finding the single best tag for a given token, they generate a probability distribution over tags (i.e., they are probabilistic as opposed to deterministic). These probabilities are combined to calculate probability scores for tag sequences, and the tag sequence with the highest probability is chosen. To handle the enormous number of possible tag sequences, only the most recent tag is examined, and dynamic programming is used. For each consecutive token index i, a score is computed for each possible current and previous tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, there is the deep learning approach. **Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)**, a type of deep bi-directional RNNs, are well-suited for chunking because they take sequences into account. [Søgaard and Goldberg (2016)](http://anthology.aclweb.org/P16-2038) have used this model for a multi-task learning architecture that combines POS tagging, syntactic chunking, and Combinatory Category Grammar (CCG) supertagging. As these tasks share a 'lot of substructure', it makes sense for the models to share parameters. POS supervision is best at the innermost rather than the outermost layer, because POS tagging represents a lower level task that feeds into higher level tasks. PyTorch is a great library for [LSTMs and sequence models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html#lstm-s-in-pytorch).\n",

    "\n",
    "This relates to *focussing on different chunk types*, which have different characteristics. It is most important to examine the chunk types that had the lowest F1 scores (this is detailed in the classification report), as improving accuracies for these chunks has the largest impact on overall accuracy. Are there certain characteristics of these chunk types not captured by feature engineering? Neither of the two instances of I-PRT was classified correctly, so its F1 score was 0.00. The next lowest chunk F1 scores are for B-INTJ (0.29) and B-CONJP (0.40). The low accuracies make sense, as these were among the least frequent tags in the dataset. \n",

    "**Memory / Out of Core Learning **\n",

    "Fitting the classifiers requires a lot of memory. A more memory-effective solution would be to train by iterating over sections of the dataset at a time. Scikit-learn has incremental classifiers that learn from batches via the `partial_fit` method. It should be noted, however, that classifier accuracies improved only marginally (by about one percentage point) when trained on 90% of the training data vs. 25%."
